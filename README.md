Software Engineering Day1 Assignment
Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engeneering principles, methods and tools to the developmemt and maintenance of high quality software systems.
Enables the software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life including communication, healthcare and commerce.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of programming language
Estabishing software engineering as a discipline
The advent of structured programming
Rise of agile methodologies.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements-gathering and documenting the user's needs and system requirements.
Design-Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
Implementation-Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
Testing-Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment-Releasing the software to users or customers.
Maintenance-Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology is the sequential approach with distinct phases,e.g, requirements, design, implementation, flowing downwards like a waterfall while 
Agile is the iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer- is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions
Quality Assurance Engineer- ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project manager- oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments-provides comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code, e.g., Visual Studio, Eclipse.
Version Control Systems- useful for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members, e.g., Git, Subversion.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing Requirements- may lead to scope creep and project delays.
Tight Deadlines- pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
Technical Debt- can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.
          Strategies to overcome these challenges
Prioritization of tasks
Regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.
Effective communication
Agile methodologies

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing-where individual code units (functions, methods, classes) are isolated and tested independently. This testing level focuses on 
verifying each unit's internal logic and functionality to ensure they operate as expected.
It can identify errors early in the development cycle, making them simpler and less costly.

Integration testing-  verifies how individual software components (modules) work together after being unit-tested. 
Ensure that modules work cohesively, leading to a stable software system.

System testing-  It ensures that the entire system meets the development criteria
 Help detect and address major issues that may influence the overall quality and functionality of the product.
 
Acceptance testing- the final stage of software testing, which ensures the software functions properly in the user's working environment.
 Acceptance testing identifies and addresses usability issues, ensuring an intuitive and satisfying system.
 
Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering- is the crafting of questions or statements to generate best possible responses from AI models.
Makes my vague qustions clear and specific, in a way the AI model understands exactly what I need.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt- what do you thin about technology?
Improved prompt-What are the pros and cons of using AI in the workforce?
The improved prompt is effective since it is specific and clearly defines the aspect of technology being discussed.
